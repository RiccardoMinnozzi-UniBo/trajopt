"""Build the alternating sunlit/eclipse segments for the GEO disposal problem.

Problem structure (Kelly and Bevilacqua 2021, Section 5.1)
----------------------------------------------------------
State   x = [p, f, g, h, k, t_elapsed]   (MEOE plus physical time)
Control u = [theta]                      (primer steering angle, rad)
Independent variable: true longitude L (rad), not physical time.

Each revolution crosses the Earth shadow once, so the trajectory is a chain of
alternating sunlit and eclipse arcs.  Every arc is one trajopt segment; the arcs
are tied together by state, control and time continuity.

The role of ``revolutions``
---------------------------
``revolutions`` is a *structural guess*, not a boundary condition.  It fixes how
many phases the problem has and it seeds the initial guess, but no arc endpoint
is held at a constant longitude:

  * every interior arc ends where the spacecraft actually crosses the shadow
    terminator, imposed as the nonconvex equality ``shadow_boundary = 0``, so the
    boundaries move as the orbit evolves;
  * the final arc ends wherever the minimum-time solution wants it to, within
    roughly one revolution either side of the nominal endpoint.

The right value of ``revolutions`` is therefore found by re-solving with one
revolution fewer until the problem stops being feasible, which is the outer loop
of the paper's Algorithm 1.  See :mod:`search`.

A window of ``terminator_window_rad`` around each nominal boundary keeps an arc
from collapsing or inverting.  The nominal eclipse arc is about 0.304 rad, so a
window of 0.05 rad still leaves every arc at least 0.2 rad long.

Simplifications relative to the reference
-----------------------------------------
* Only Earth gravity (no lunar/solar third-body perturbations).
* Fixed inertial Sun direction (no time-varying ephemeris).

Scaling
-------
Every state is scaled by the amplitude of its allowed interval (paper Eq. 44),
and the longitude by the nominal swept longitude, so all nondimensional
variables and their derivatives are O(1).
